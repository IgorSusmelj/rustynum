# RustyNum

RustyNum is a high-performance numerical computation library written in Rust, created to demonstrate the potential of Rust's SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) capabilities using the nightly `portable_simd` feature, and serving as a fast alternative to Numpy.

## Key Features

- **High Performance:** Utilizes Rust's `portable_simd` for accelerated numerical operations across various hardware platforms, achieving up to 2.86x faster computations for certain operations compared to Numpy.
- **Python Bindings:** Seamless integration with Python, providing a familiar Numpy-like interface.
- **Lightweight:** Minimal dependencies (no external crates are used), ensuring a small footprint and easy deployment. RustyNum Python wheels are only 300kBytes (50x smaller than Numpy wheels).

## Installation

Supported Python versions: `3.8`, `3.9`, `3.10`, `3.11`, `3.12`

Supported operating systems: `Windows x86`, `Linux x86`, `MacOS x86 & ARM`

For comprehensive documentation, tutorials, and API reference, visit [rustynum.com](https://rustynum.com).

### For Python

You can install RustyNum directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install rustynum
```

> If that does not work for you please create an issue with the operating system and Python version you're using!

## Quick Start Guide (Python)

If you're familiar with Numpy, you'll quickly get used to RustyNum!

```Python
import numpy as np
import rustynum as rnp

# Using Numpy
a = np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0], dtype="float32")
a = a + 2
print(a.mean())  # 4.5

# Using RustyNum
b = rnp.NumArray([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0], dtype="float32")
b = b + 2
print(b.mean().item())  # 4.5
```

### Advanced Usage

You can perform advanced operations such as matrix-vector and matrix-matrix multiplications:

```Python
# Matrix-vector dot product using Numpy
import numpy as np
import rustynum as rnp

a = np.random.rand(4 * 4).astype(np.float32)
b = np.random.rand(4).astype(np.float32)
result_numpy = np.dot(a.reshape((4, 4)), b)

# Matrix-vector dot product using RustyNum
a_rnp = rnp.NumArray(a.tolist())
b_rnp = rnp.NumArray(b.tolist())
result_rust = a_rnp.reshape([4, 4]).dot(b_rnp).tolist()

print(result_numpy)  # Example Output: [0.8383043, 1.678406, 1.4153088, 0.7959367]
print(result_rust)   # Example Output: [0.8383043, 1.678406, 1.4153088, 0.7959367]
```

# From a list
a = NumArray([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], dtype="float32")

# From another NumArray
b = NumArray(a)

# From nested lists (2D array)
c = NumArray([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]], dtype="float64")
```

Methods

Reshapes the array to the specified shape.

```Python
reshaped = a.reshape([3, 1])
```

`matmul(other: NumArray) -> NumArray`

```Python
result = a.matmul(b)
# or
result = a @ b
```

`dot(other: NumArray) -> NumArray`

Computes the dot product with another NumArray.

```Python
dot_product = a.dot(b)
```

`mean(axis: Union[None, int, Sequence[int]] = None) -> Union[NumArray, float]`

Computes the mean along specified axis.

```Python
average = a.mean()
average_axis0 = a.mean(axis=0)
```

`min(axis: Union[None, int, Sequence[int]] = None) -> Union[NumArray, float]`

Returns the minimum value in the array.

```Python
minimum = a.min()
```

Not Planned:

- Random number generation (use the rand crate)

## Design Principles

RustyNum is built on four core principles:

1. **No 3rd Party Dependencies:** Ensuring transparency and control over the codebase.
2. **Leverage Portable SIMD:** Utilizing Rust's nightly SIMD feature for high-performance operations across platforms.
3. **First-Class Language Bindings:** Providing robust support for Python, with plans for WebAssembly and C++.
4. **Numpy-like Interface:** Offering a familiar and intuitive user experience for those coming from Python.

## Performance

### Python

RustyNum leverages Rust's `portable_simd` feature to achieve significant performance improvements in numerical computations. On a MacBook Pro M1 Pro, RustyNum outperforms Numpy in several key operations. Below are benchmark results comparing `RustyNum 0.1.4` with `Numpy 1.24.4`:

#### Observations

- RustyNum significantly outperforms Numpy in basic operations such as mean, min, and dot product, with speedup factors over 2x.
- For larger operations, especially matrix-vector and matrix-matrix multiplications, Numpy currently performs better, which highlights areas for potential optimization in RustyNum.

These results demonstrate RustyNum's potential for high-performance numerical computations, particularly in operations where SIMD instructions can be fully leveraged.

### Rust

In addition to the Python bindings, RustyNum’s core library is implemented in Rust. Below is a comparison of RustyNum (rustynum_rs) with two popular Rust numerical libraries: `nalgebra 0.33.0` and `ndarray 0.16.1`. The benchmarks were conducted using the Criterion crate to measure performance across various basic operations.

#### Benchmark Results (float32)

| Input Size                                  | RustyNum  | nalgebra  | ndarray   |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------- | --------- | --------- |
| Addition (10k elements)                     | 760.53 ns | 695.73 ns | 664.29 ns |
| Vector mean (10k elements)                  | 683.83 ns | 14.602 µs | 1.2370 µs |
| Vector Dot Product (10k elements)           | 758.65 ns | 1.1843 µs | 1.1942 µs |
| Matrix-Vector Multiplication (1k elements)  | 77.851 us | 403.39 µs | 115.75 µs |
| Matrix-Matrix Multiplication (500 elements) | 2.5526 ms | 2.9038 ms | 2.7847 ms |
| Matrix-Matrix Multiplication (1k elements)  | 17.836 ms | 21.895 ms | 22.423 ms |

#### Observations

- RustyNum is able to perform on par with nalgebra and ndarray in most operations and sometimes even outperforms them.
- There seems a significant overhead in the Python bindings. We're getting 10ms in Python in RustyNum for the matrix-vector multiplication with 1k elements vs 77us in Rust.
