# Welcome to RustyNum!

**RustyNum** is a high-performance numerical computation library written in Rust, designed to be faster, lighter, and simpler than traditional solutions. With seamless Python bindings, RustyNum empowers developers and data scientists to achieve efficient computation with minimal overhead.

---

## 🚀 What is RustyNum?

RustyNum is built to demonstrate the potential of **Rust's SIMD capabilities** while providing a **NumPy-like interface** for Python users. Whether you're working on machine learning, data analysis, or scientific computing, RustyNum offers:

- **Up to 2.86x faster computations** than NumPy for key operations.
- **Lightweight and portable** Python wheels (300 KB vs. NumPy’s ~15 MB).
- **Minimal dependencies**, ensuring quick and easy deployment.

## 🏆 Key Features

### High Performance
- Utilizes Rust's `portable_simd` for lightning-fast computations.
- Optimized for matrix and vector operations, with support for advanced numerical tasks.
- Matrix operations use additional multithreading for parallelization. Multithreading is currently not supported for any other operations.

### Seamless Python Integration
- Python bindings offer a familiar interface for NumPy users.
- Compatible with popular Python versions (3.8 - 3.12).

### Lightweight and Portable
- No external Rust crates used—keeping the codebase simple and transparent.
- Tiny footprint ensures quick installations and smooth deployments.
